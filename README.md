# T1Breaker

This was my very first script. I wrote this for a game called Hackmud to facillitate more efficient acquisition of the in game currency. Before playing the game I had never written code. This game encouraged players to learn JavaScript and write scripts to modify and automate certain game activities. I found learning and writing code so entertaining that I became more interested in learning programming than in continuing the game.

I have included a few of my earlier versions as a point of reference, however "t1dozerrework" was my final product. The script uses single letter variables in order to meet the character contraints of the game. It may be worthwhile for me to return to this script at a later date because I have heard it is possible to perform this function in less than 500 characters and I would be interested to see if I could figure out how to simplify the function with more experience.
